1. Run the "kNN_Classifier.py"
2. Make sure that the datasets (taining and testing) are in the appropriate folder location as referenced in the source

* The execution reads the training-set and the test-set and cleans both and saves them into seperate csv files
# Then it creates the feature vector from the words in the formatted training abstracts.
# Then it calculates the tf-idf (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) values for the selected words
# Finally looping through each of the formatted test abstract it calls the "findBestLabel" method to classify them into appropriate categories.

The code executed for a long period since it involves multiple steps of cleaning the data, vectorizing, calculating the tf-idf values and etc. Besides prediction per sample also takes up to 5-6 seconds once the prediction loop has begun.
