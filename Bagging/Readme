For bagging we used excel to combine all final prediction from different classifier into one sheet. We just put 5 columns for 5 different classifers in file called
ensemble.csv
1. Open ipython shell and type following commands.
2. run ensemble.py
3. ensemble()
4. A file called ensemble_out.csv is generated which is our final submission.
